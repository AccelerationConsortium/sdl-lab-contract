"""STATUS_SPEC device-contract types — the authoritative shared copy.

Mirrors ``docs/STATUS_SPEC.md`` in ``ac-organic-lab`` (spec v1.2). This
package replaces the per-repo vendored ``models.py`` copies: device repos and
the ``lab-skills`` SDK ``from sdl_lab_contract import ...`` instead.

Scope: ONLY the wire contract (the ``/status`` envelope, probe/health bodies,
and the §5 claim-protocol bodies in :mod:`sdl_lab_contract.claims`).
Aggregator/runtime types (``FetchError``, ``EquipmentSnapshot``, …) are
deliberately NOT here — they describe a reader's view, not the contract, and
live in ``lab_skills.models``.

Versioning: the package version's major.minor equals the spec revision these
types mirror (see ``pyproject.toml``). Spec ships before code — never change
these models ahead of a merged ``STATUS_SPEC.md`` revision.

    a positive claim it never made.

    v1.1: :attr:`allowed_actions` is the device's own declaration of what it
    would honor right now. v1.0 devices that omit it see an empty list, and
    readers fall back to catalog ``requires_states``. ``details.claimed_by``
    (a :class:`sdl_lab_contract.claims.ClaimedBy`-shaped dict, or absent)
    stays nested under :attr:`details` to keep the top-level shape stable for
    v1.0 readers.

    v1.2: :attr:`activity` / :attr:`activity_since` answer "is it working",
    which :attr:`equipment_status` cannot express once §2.2 gives the
    top-level state to health. A v1.0/v1.1 device omitting them reads as
